# flipbook-block

Simple Wordpress block that shows a PDF from your Media in a Flip Book, for your visitors to turn the pages.

You can easily choose the width, height and alignment, the Book will adapt accordingly on load.

Depending on demand, I can work on more features such as: Compatibility with images, more size units, choosing a different template, changing background-color and more.
