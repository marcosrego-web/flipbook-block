Simple Wordpress block that shows a PDF from your Media in a Flip Book, for your visitors to turn the pages.

== Description ==

Simple Wordpress block that shows a PDF from your Media in a Flip Book, for your visitors to turn the pages.

You can easily choose the width, height and alignment, the Book will adapt accordingly on load.

Depending on demand, I can work on more features such as: Compatibility with images, more size units, choosing a different template, changing background-color and more.

**Credits:**
This plugin grabbed [iamapinan's pdf-html5-page-flip](https://github.com/iamapinan/pdf-html5-page-flip), that uses the [turn.js](http://www.turnjs.com/) library.
